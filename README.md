  <h1>Khwarazmi Robot – Motion Control with Arduino and LabVIEW</h1>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    This repository is created for the Khwarazmi Robot project and includes the implementation 
    of the robot’s motion control system using Arduino and LabVIEW. In this project, besides 
    the automatic robot control, a manual control feature has been implemented to allow the 
    user to directly adjust the robot’s path and movements when needed.

  <h2>How to Run</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the Arduino folder in the Arduino IDE and upload the code to the Arduino board.</li>
    <li>Launch LabVIEW and open the Khwarazmi Robot project.</li>
    <li>Establish a connection between LabVIEW and the Arduino (via USB or other communication protocols).</li>
    <li>If manual control is needed, use the Controller section in LabVIEW to maneuver the robot.</li>
